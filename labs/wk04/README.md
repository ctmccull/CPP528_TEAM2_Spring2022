## Lab o4
### Part 1 - Data
- create a dataset that includes 2000 and 2010 census variables drop all rural census tracts.
- Create a variable that measures the growth of median home value from 2000 to 2010.
- Omit cases that have a median home value less than $10,000 in 2000.
- Omit cases with growth rates above 200%.

### Part 2 - Predict MHV Change
- Select at least three census variables that you feel will be good predictors of change in MHV between 2000 and 2010.
- Run the model while including metro-level fixed effects (cbsa name or FIPS). 
- Make sure you check for variable skew and multicollinearity and adjust accordingly.
