# Lab 05

- add federal program data to your models. Save a local copy within your labs/wk05/ sub-directory
- use the difference-in-difference framework introduced in the tutorial to estimate the impact of each federal program: the NMTC and the LIHTC.
- Use your baseline model predicting tract change from Lab 04 as the starting point.
- Create a log-linear diff-in-diff model following these steps and add your control variables from Lab 04.
