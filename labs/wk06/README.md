## Lab-06

- Create a single `.R` file that is used in both Lab 04 and Lab 05. 
- Then, re-write your `import::here()` statement to pull from this singular `.R` file that should be referenced in both Lab 04 and Lab 05.
- Create two new Lab 04 and Lab 05 files within your `labs/wk06/ directory`. Though these are “new” files, none of the output from either file should change
