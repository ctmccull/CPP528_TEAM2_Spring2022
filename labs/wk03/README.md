## Lab-02

#### Part 01 - Change in Home Values
Reproduce the descriptive analysis demonstrated in the tutorial but do it for periods 1990 to 2000 instead of the 2000 to 2010 period used in the tutorial. 
#### Part 02 - Measuring Gentrification
- create a new variable in your dataset that allows you to operationalize gentrification and examine its prevalance in the data. 
- How many census tracts are candidates (start out at a low income level with high diversity)? 
- And of those how many have transitioned into advanced stages of gentrification?
- Provide an explanation and justification of the way you measure gentrification in the data.
### Part 03 - Spatial Patterns
Histograms and scatterplots help us understand the statistical properties and relationships between variables in the dataset.
