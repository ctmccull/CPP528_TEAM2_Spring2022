**Results**

*NMTC results without including control variables*

In this model without any control variables added, New Market Tax Credit investments had a significant effect on median home values, with the value of homes in tracts that received NMTC investments increasing less than those in tracts without NMTC. The median house value was $5892.20 less in 2010 data than would be expected if NMTC investments were not made. However, because NMTC are only allowed in tracts identified because of poverty or low family incomes, this finding seems likely to be the result of confounding variables such as poverty.

*NMTC results with control variables*

We have chosen Variables of interest; Percent white residents in 2000 (p.white.00), Percent with 4-year college education or more (p.col.edu.00) and Poverty rate in 2000 (pov.rate.00) to predict if the New Market Tax Credit investments had a significant effect on median home value. 

With the above control variables, we found that; when percent white residents, percent of college educated residents, and poverty rate in 2000 are included as controls, New Market Tax Credits had a significant effect on median home value. New Market Tax Credits resulted in a median home value of $166,560.50, an increase of $7681 over the expected value if New Market Tax Credits had not been utilized

*LIHTC results without control variables*

In this model, which does not include any control variables, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program did not have a significant effect on median home values from 200 to 2010.

*LIHTC results with control variables*

Similar to the New Market Tax Credits we have chosen Variables of interest; Percent white residents in 2000 (p.white.00), Percent with 4-year college education or more (p.col.edu.00) and Poverty rate in 2000 (pov.rate.00) to predict if the N Low Income Housing Tax Credit program had a significant effect on median home value.

the results shows that, the Low Income Housing Tax Credits did not have a significant effect on median home values. In this model, median home price is nearly identical in tracts with or without LIHTC.


*Reflection on Testing the parallel lines assumption in this mode*

Examining longitudinal data from points before and/or after the timeframe in question would provide evidence that the parallel trends assumption is met, that both the treatment and control groups would have changed at the same rate in the absence of the treatment.
